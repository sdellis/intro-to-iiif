						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>IIIF is a series of APIs (application programming interface) that worked together to enable access for images on the Web.
						What the heck does that mean?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>For one thing, it means that content providers can publish high-resolution images that are quickly viewable at great detail.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>It also means that IIIF users can read and collaboratively annotate a published books.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>It means a whole lot of things, and this overview aims to break things down.</p>
					</section>

						<h2>What is IIIF?</h2>
						<p>I said earlier that IIIF is a series of APIs that allows you to access images on the Web.
							These APIs are community and use case driven and really were formed out of common needs from
							organizations delivering images on the Web.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This can be as simple as just putting an image tag in a webpage.</p>
						<p><img src="https://stacks.stanford.edu/image/iiif/hg676jb4964%2F0380_796-44/1015,1460,799,824/pct:25/0/default.jpg"></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Or as advanced as reading a large book in its entirety.</p>
						<iframe src="https://universalviewer.io/uv.html?manifest=https://api.bl.uk/metadata/iiif/ark:/81055/vdc_00000004216E/manifest.json" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Both of these use cases utilize IIIF. The API specifications enable all of this to be made possible in a standardized way. Simply put, IIIF enables organizations to solve common problems together.</p>
						<p>IIIF not only refers to these APIs now, but now also to the community of content providers, software developers, and researchers who are using the technology.</p>
					</section>

						<h2>What can IIIF do?</h2>
						<p>We just saw that IIIF has several applications for using images on the Web. There are many more.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>IIIF can be used for georeferencing historic maps</p>
						<figure class="figure">
					    <a href="http://www.georeferencer.com/">
					      <img src="https://www.learniiif.org/assets/georeferencer.jpg" class="img-fluid">
					    </a>
					    <figcaption class="figure-caption">GeoRefencer</figcaption>
					  </figure>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Or work with others to annotatate a manuscript</p>
						<figure class="figure">
					    <a href="http://projectmirador.org/">
					      <img src="https://www.learniiif.org/assets/mirador-anno.gif" class="img-fluid">
					    </a>
					  </figure>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Because these images are delivered using the IIIF API specifications. Different viewers, clients, and applications can reuse the exact same content!</p>
						<p>The API specifications have been driven by community use cases and integration with other Web standards.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>As of September 2017 the current IIIF Technical Specifications are:</p>
							<ul>
							  <li><a href="http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/">IIIF Image API</a></li>
							  <li><a href="http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1">IIIF Presentation API</a></li>
							  <li><a href="http://iiif.io/api/auth/1.0">IIIF Authentication API</a></li>
							  <li><a href="http://iiif.io/api/search/1.0">IIIF Search API</a></li>
							</ul>
						<p>The two most established IIIF APIs are the Image and Presentation APIs. Let’s get started with the Image API.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Image API</h2>
						<p>The IIIF Image API is designed for standardization of requesting and delivering images on the Web. What does that mean beyond the <img> tag?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We saw earlier that you can use it to embed an image in a webpage. Here is that example again.</p>
						<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/sdellis/vjpgsbfw/embedded/result,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
						<p>This example uses the Image API to request an image from a IIIF image server. If you click on “HTML” you can see the URL that is being requested.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre><code class="hljs">&lt;img src="https://stacks.stanford.edu/image/iiif/hg676jb4964%2F0380_796-44/1015,1460,799,824/pct:50/0/default.jpg"&gt;</code></pre>
						<p>This URL is crafted to extract a specific region, at a relative size, from the high quality original image.
							The original image is measured at 5426 x 3820 pixels and has a file size of 4.7MB. Having users download the
							entire file is inefficient and will likely provide a poor user experience. The IIIF Image API allows you to
							serve out derivative versions of these images in a standardized way, without having to generate derivates
							in advance.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Zoomable Images</h3>
						<iframe src="https://mejackreed.github.io/Leaflet-IIIF/examples/index.html?url=https://stacks.stanford.edu/image/iiif/hg676jb4964%2F0380_796-44/info.json" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Several different libraries now exist to use the IIIF Image API to provide a “deep zoom” for the images.
							The previous slide contains an example of the Leaflet-IIIF displaying the same image we looked at previously.
							Here you can see the entire image and zoom in with great detail. Using tiled zoom enables viewing of high
							resolution images without needing to download the full resolution images.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>How does all of this work?</h3>
						<p>The IIIF Image API server knows how to efficiently deliver these images to the viewer client.
							The viewer client knows what types of images that it can request from the server.
							The client gets this information from the server through a Image Information request.</p>

						<p>Let’s dive into more of how the Image API works.</p>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Image API Playground</h3>
					<p>The IIIF Image API makes requests to images using a specified URI syntax which changes what image is requested.
						The syntax consists of a way to identify the image to be requested, as well as additional parameters that can be
						used to modify the way the image comes back. These request parameters can modify the region of the image, its size,
						rotation, quality, and the image format.
						See the <a href="http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/#image-request-parameters">API documentation</a> for parameter options
						you can use.</p>
